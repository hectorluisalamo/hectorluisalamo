## hey, I’m Hector 👋

Writer and editor by training.  
Builder and engineer by obsession.

I think at the intersection of **language, software, and creativity**. I build because tools shape who gets access—and too many people are still left out.

## current deep dives

- 📱 mobile apps, especially consumer-facing products that actually ship  
- 🧠 RAG systems, agentic AI, and human-in-the-loop workflows  
- 🗣️ bilingual NLP (English / Spanish / Spanglish)  
- 🎮 educational games for kids  
- 🧰 AI tools that help people *do things*, not just talk about them  

Right now I’m shipping a **mobile fitness app for Latinas** who want to get strong and healthy without giving up the foods they love.

## beliefs

- good software should be **useful, user-friendly, and pretty**
- small teams win because they’re **nimble, curious, and not afraid of mistakes**
- AI is dangerous when used without understanding or purpose, but powerful when it **translates human vision into reality**
- simplicity scales; over-engineering doesn’t
- tech isn’t for “some people” — it’s for anyone with curiosity and drive

I reject gatekeeping, needless complexity, and the idea that technology has to feel cold.

I believe in the **beauty and boundless potential of humanity**.

## a little background

I spent years as a managing editor and contributor at small, independent Latino media companies. That work shaped how I think: clarity matters, language matters, and systems always reflect values.

The throughline from writing to engineering is simple:  
**words have always moved people... and now they also move machines**.

My mom is a Honduran immigrant, my dad's Puerto Rican, but I identify most with the city that taught me how culture, grit, and creativity coexist — Chicago.

## interests (outside the IDE)

- history, culture, travel  
- books (Bukowski, Hunter S. Thompson, Kerouac)  
- language in all its messy, powerful forms  
- learning, learning, forever learning

---

## why follow me

- experiments & prototypes  
- production code as I ship more products  
- notes, tools, and half-finished ideas  
- projects shaped by curiosity, not hype  

I’m open to collaboration, feedback, and fellowship, because earning scales best when it’s shared.
